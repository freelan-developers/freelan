libasiotap
==========

libasiotap provides a portable C++ TAP adapter extension for the Boost::ASIO library.

It is mainly based on [boost::asio](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_47_0/doc/html/boost_asio.html).

The library can deal with any TAP adapter device that has the same interface as OpenVPN's one (commonly called "tap0901").

The source code for such a TAP adapter as well as the source code for a tool to install/remove a TAP adapter is provided.

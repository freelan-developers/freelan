# Installers

To build the Windows installer, you will need to install the Freelan build tools
Python/SCons scripts.

Building an installer on Windows also requires [Inno
Setup](http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php).

You will also need to compile the `tap-setup.exe` tool from
`libs/asiotap/windows/tap_adapter/tap-setup` using the WDK 10. You will find
detailed instructions inside this directory.

Thank you for installing FreeLAN !
==================================

Your FreeLAN installation was successful. Congratulations !

Freelan runs as a Windows service transparently in the background. You can look
for it in the Control Panel > System and Security > Administrative Tools >
Services menu.

There is currently no graphical user interface for FreeLAN: FreeLAN will
automatically connect to the configured network when your computer starts and
will gracefully disconnect when it shuts down.

By default, the FreeLAN configuration is very simple and should be modified to
fit your needs. It's default location is "<FreeLAN installation
path>\config\freelan.cfg" which should resolve to "C:\Program
Files\FreeLAN\config\freelan.cfg" in most cases. See
https://github.com/freelan-developers/freelan-all/wiki for a complete guide
about how to do that.

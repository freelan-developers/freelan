Libraries
---------

It contains the following projects:

 - [libcryptoplus](https://github.com/freelan-developers/libcryptoplus) - A C++ wrapper around the OpenSSL cryptographic library.
 - [libiconvplus](https://github.com/freelan-developers/libiconvplus) - A C++ wrapper around the iconv library.

 - [libfreelan](https://github.com/freelan-developers/libfreelan) - The FreeLAN C++ library.
 - [freelan](https://github.com/freelan-developers/freelan) - The FreeLAN binary.
 - [freelan-server](https://github.com/freelan-developers/freelan-server) - The FreeLAN configuration server.
 - [libkfather](https://github.com/freelan-developers/libkfather) - A C++ JSON parser/producer with a terrible name.

To fetch those from their respective repositories, issue the following commands:

> git submodule init

> git submodule update

And, to get the last revision for each repository:

> git submodule foreach git checkout master

Building
--------

You may setup quickly a building environment by calling the appropriate script at `tools/<your operating system>/setup-environment`.

If no script exists for your operating system, read the instructions in `freelan-buildtools/README.md`.

This directory contains a `SConstruct` file which uses the [FreeLAN builds tools](https://github.com/freelan-developers/freelan-buildtools) to build the contained projects.

The default target (`freelan`) builds and installs all the necessary files for FreeLAN and FreeLAN itself to the environment specified `FREELAN_INSTALL_PREFIX` (or a OS-dependent default prefix if none is specified).

To do that, just type:

> scons

To build everything in the directory (all sub-projects), type instead:

> scons build

To build then install everything from the directory (all sub-projects), type instead:

> scons install

Packaging
----------

See the `README.md` file into the `packaging` directory.

Does the project have a website ?

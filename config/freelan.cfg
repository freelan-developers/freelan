[server]

# Whether to use the server mechanism.
#
# The server mechanism allow a host to delegate some parameters of its
# configuration to an external server.
#
# If this mode is enabled, any specified certificate or private for the user
# will be discarded and a new ones, generated and signed by the server will be
# used instead.
#
# The server has to be reachable on startup for freelan to work. If the server
# becomes unreachable after the network has been established, all existing
# connections will keep going.
#
# Possible values: yes, no
#
# Default: no
enabled=no

# The server host to synchronize with.
#
# This can be a hostname or a numeric IPv4 or IPv6 address with or without a
# TCP port specifier.
# If no TCP port is specified, 443 (HTTPS) is assumed.
#
# This connection is *ALWAYS* performed using HTTPS, whatever the TCP port
# specified.
#
# Example values: hostname, some.other.host.org:443, 10.0.0.1:443
# Default: <none>
#host=

# The HTTPS proxy to use, if any.
#
# This can be a hostname or a numeric IPv4 or IPv6 address with or without a
# TCP port specifier.
# If no TCP port is specified, 1080 is assumed.
#
# If no HTTPS proxy is specified, freelan will take the system defaults, as
# specified with the http_proxy, https_proxy, all_proxy environment variables.
#
# Setting this value to an empty string disables the proxy mechanism.

# Example values: hostname, some.other.host.org:8080, 10.0.0.1:8080
# Default: <none>
#https_proxy=

# The username.
#
# The identifier to use to connect on the specified server host.
#
# Default: <none>
#username=

# The password.
#
# The password associated to the specified username.
#
# If no password is specified, freelan will check for the existence of a
# FREELAN_SERVER_PASSWORD environment variable instead.
#
# Default: <value of the FREELAN_SERVER_PASSWORD environment variable>
#password=

# The network.
#
# The network to join on the specified server.
#
# If no network is specified, freelan will check for the existence of a
# FREELAN_SERVER_NETWORK environment variable instead.
#
# Default: <value of the FREELAN_SERVER_NETWORK environment variable>
#network=

# The endpoints to announce to the other hosts.
#
# Those endpoints will be send, as they are, to other hosts wanting to reach
# us. You may specify IP adresses or host names.
#
# There are also some special values:
#
# - 0.0.0.0 as a host part will be replaced by the server with your known public
# IPv4 address. If you are connected to the server with an IPv6 address, this
# entry will be ignored.
# - :: as a host part will be replaced by the server with your known public IPv6
# address. If you are connected to the server with an IPv4 address, this entry
# will be ignored.
# - If no port number is specified, then the port specified in the `listen_on`
# directive will be used.
#
# You may repeat the public_endpoint option to add several endpoints.
#
# This option is useful when you host freelan behind a NAT firewall with
# redirections. It allows to inform the others peers of your public IP address.
#
# Default: 0.0.0.0, ::
public_endpoint=0.0.0.0
public_endpoint=::

# The user agent.
#
# Set this option to change the user agent of the freelan HTTP client.
#
# Changing the user agent might be useful in situations where a ill-configured
# proxy put constraints on some user agents.
#
# Setting this option to an empty value will make freelan use the default
# libcurl user agent.
#
# Not setting this option will make freelan use its default user agent.
#
# Default: <none>
#user_agent=

# The protocol.
#
# The protocol to use to contact the server.
#
# You probably should *NEVER* change this option !

#
# Possible values: http, https
#
# Default: https
#protocol=https

# The CA info file.
#
# If set, specifies a file holding one or more certificates to verify the
# freelan server with.
#
# This option is passed as-is to libcurl
# (http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/curl_easy_setopt.html#CURLOPTCAINFO).
#
# If the option is not set, or is set to an empty value, the system default
# value is taken.
#
# This option is *ONLY* used when verifying the certificate of the freelan
# server.
#
# Default: <none>
#ca_info_file=

# Disable peer verification.
#
# Enabling this option disable peer verification, making the connection A LOT
# LESS SECURE.
#
# Use this for configuration testing purposes only !
#
# Possible values: yes, no
#
# This option is *ONLY* used when verifying the certificate of the freelan
# server.
#
# Default: no
#disable_peer_verification=no

# Disable host verification.
#
# Enabling this option disable host verification, making the connection less
# secure.
#
# Host verification ensures that the host specified in the server's certificate
# matches the host to which the request was sent in the first place.
#
# Disabling it allows trivial man-in-the-middle attacks.
#
# Use this for configuration testing purposes only !
#
# Possible values: yes, no

#
# Possible values: yes, no
#
# Default: yes
accept_contact_requests=yes

# Whether to accept contacts.
#
# If set to yes, freelan will accept contacts sent by other hosts and will try

#
# If no name or an empty name is provided, the first available adapter will be
# used.
#
# On UNIX, it is the name of the tap adapter to create. Depending on your
# system, some names might be restricted, and something in the form of tapX
# (where X is a positive number) is recommended.
